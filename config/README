This directory contains various configuration files for *radiod*,
*opusd* and other daemons part of ka9q-radio.  They are installed into
/etc/radio. However, the --ignore-existing flag is used with rsync so
that existing config files will NOT be overwritten. Until I find a
better way to manage local and upstream-managed config files, you will
have to manually merge your own config files with those from the
upstream (i.e. my) distribution.
